0:i:The City of Ladue's sign ordinance abridges Margaret P. Gilleo's First Amendment Right to Free Speech.
1:a:0:The City has the right to regulate the display of residential signs.
2:s:1:The proliferation of residential signs has side effects, that are compelling interests.
3:s:2:Signs cause "ugliness and ... visual blight and clutter"
4:s:2:Signs would "tarnish the natural beauty of the landscape as well as the residential and commercial architecture"
5:s:2:Signs would "impair property values, substantially impinge upon the privacy and special ambience of the community"
6:s:2:Signs may cause "safety and traffic hazards to motorists, pedestrians, and children[.]"
7:s:0:The ordinance prohibits too much protected speech.
8:s:7:"Ladue's ordinance covers even such absolutely pivotal speech as a sign protesting an imminent governmental decision to go to war."
9:s:7:"...residential signs play an important part in political campaigns, during which they are displayed to signal the resident's support for particular candidates, parties, or causes."
10:s:0:No satisfactory alternatives exist for residential signs.
11:s:10:"Precisely because of their location, such signs provide information about the identity of the -speaker.-"
12:s:10:"Residential signs are an unusually cheap and convenient form of communication."
13:s:12:"Especially for persons of modest means or limited mobility, a yard or window sign may have no practical substitute."
14:a:7:The ordinance is content-neutral.
15:a:14:The ordinance extempts certain kinds of signs, e.g. For Sale, For Rent, etc.
16:s:15:"[The exemptions] may diminish the credibility of the government's rationale for restricting speech in the first place."
17:s:16:"Ladue has concluded that the interest in allowing certain messages to be conveyed by means of residential signs outweighs the City's aesthetic interest in eliminating outdoor signs."
18:s:15:"An exemption from an otherwise permissible regulation of speech may represent a governmental -attempt to give one side of a debatable public question an advantage in expressing its views to the people.-"
19:s:14:"The mix of prohibitions and exemptions in the ordinance, Ladue maintains, reflects legitimate differences among the side effects of various kinds of signs."
20:s:19:".. according to the Declaration of Findings, Policies, Interests, and Purposes supporting the ordinance, the permitted signs, unlike the prohibited signs, are unlikely to contribute to the dangers of -unlimited proliferation- "
21:a:2:"Ladue's sign ordinance is supported principally by the City's interest in minimizing the visual clutter associated with signs, an interest that is concededly valid but certainly no more compelling than the interests at stake in Linmark."
22:s:21:"We are confident that more temperate measures could in large part satisfy Ladue's stated regulatory needs without harm to the First Amendment rights of its citizens."
24:s:21:"In Linmark we held that the City's interest in maintaining a stable, racially integrated neighborhood was not sufficient to support a prohibition of residential -For Sale- signs."
23:s:14:"Ladue contends...that its ordinance is a mere regulation of the -time, place, or manner- of speech because residents remain free to convey their desired messages by other means..."
25:s:19:Governments can regulate physical characteristics within reasonable bounds.
26:s:25:Ward v. Rock Against Racism
27:s:25:Kovacs v. Cooper
