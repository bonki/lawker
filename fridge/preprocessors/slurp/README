SLURP is a simple module system for gawk based on uses gawk/make by
tim@menzies.us (http://menzies.us).

Modules to include are denoted with a 

#use "file name"

Note that "file name" will be included before including the file
containing the above "#use".

By default, SLURP assumes that there is a file main.awk that is your top level driver
of everything else. This can be changed using

      make it=otherName 

i.e. you main file is otherName.awk.

The main call is

      make args="..."

that finds all the included files "f1" "f2" then runs

     gawk -f f1 -f f2 -f main.awk args

A call to

       make profile args="..."

will do the run and print out that profile.out report showing how many
times lines were called (this is handy for checking for dead code or functions
that are candidates for optimization). By default, this profile is written
to $HOME/tmp/profile.out. You can change this default by

       make tmp=dir profile args="..."

A call to

       make build

will combine all the files into one file and adds the #!`which gawk` -f
shebang string at the top of the file.  Note: i find "build" very
useful for shipping one file to a client. By default, it writes
a file called "main" main but you can change that using

      make it=otherName build
