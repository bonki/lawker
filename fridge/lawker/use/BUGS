USE was written very fast from some stuff I did about 2 years
ago. So buyer beware.

As to known bugs...


1) Also, I don't like the way USE users have to pass in the command
   line args using

       make args="..."

   I'd be open to alternate proposals.

2) Use has no knowledge of search paths so you have to use the entire
   path name. It really needs to use VPATH or AWKPATH to find its
   files.
