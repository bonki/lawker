This directory uses XUNIT to define the unit tests for AWK-LIBRARY.

These test suite is a work in progress. Feel free to add in!

To write new tests, add an executable "eg/N". Then, cache the output
of that test using

   make do=N cache

In future, to run just that new test, use

   make do=N test

To run all tests,

   cd tests
   make

To debug failed tests,

   cd tests
   make watch

The file "eg/setup" contains all initializiations you require before
running any test.

The file "eg/teardown" contains all clean code to run after you run tests.

Please note the following convention. Use some temp directory for any
files written by the test cases. This reduces the clutter in the
directory containing the test cases.
