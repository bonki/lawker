===================
because it jsut doesn't matter
i have an ide: emacs.unix

i have development environment:
- version control, backed up onto the web
- discussion tools (a google news group, a wikispaces wiki, chat, email)
- test driven development (eg subdirectory with x.want files)
- library of functions stored in a directory, indexed by ctags
- emacs/vim ctags intergration means by code is hyperlinked by function name

because here are the factors that control software economics
- boehm

bcasue its principles other the code that matter
- algorhtms O(logn)

because i am not just doing but also constantly explainin to people what i have to do
- awk exels at the one off report
- if i wrote in other languages, i'd still be writing the reports with awk scripts

because i teach 3rd year students programming languages and they eat
awk quickly, chew smalltalk slower, and barph at lisp. the added power
and functionality of these languages confuses them.

because i do a lot of stochastic stuff and so i've given away overly complex algorithms
in favor of simpler stochastic ones

because i do a lot of data mining and i keep finding that simple bayes
approaches consistently do better than anything else- and bayes is a snap in awk (see awk)
