<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/lawker/source/browse/">LAWKER</a>
 is a repository of  Awk code divided into:
<dl>
<dt>fridge
</dt><dd> Fresh code (for the current trunk).  Best place to
start is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/lawker/source/browse/fridge/gawk/">fridge/gawk</a>.
<dt>block</dt><dd>Place to chop up and experiment with code. Usually, avoid this one.
<dt>freezer</dt><dd>Frozen code. place to store tags. Currently, empty. But we plan to
grow this one.
<dt>wiki</dt><dd>Wiki pages. Useful for documentation but, where possible, use the
in-line pretty print method, described below.</dd>
</dl>
</ul>
<h2>How to contribute to LAWKER</h2>
<p>Mail contribitions to <a href="mailto:mail@awk.info?subject=code contribution">mail@awk.info</a> with
the subject line <em>code contribution</em>.
<p>Alternatively, members of LAWKER can  just <em>svn commit</em> their code.
<a name="prettyPrint"></a><h2> Pretty Print Code</h2>
<p>The code that renders the awk.info web site can "pretty print" awk code stored
in lawker.  For example,
<a href="http://awk.info/?gawk/array/join.awk">http://awk.info/?gawk/array/join.awk</a>
pretty
prints the Awk code found in
<a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/gawk/array/join.awk">join.awk</a>.
<p>
To enable that pretty print, add some html syntax inside your
code and apply the following conventions:
<ul>
<li> The first paragraph of the file will be ignored. Use this first para
for copyright notices or comments about down-in-the weeds trivia. Note: the
first para ends with one blank line.

<li>The next paragraph should start with 
<pre><code>#.H1 &lt;join>Title&lt;/join></code></pre>

<li> The code could should be topped and tailed as follows:
<pre>
#&lt;pre>
code
#&lt;/pre>
</pre>
<li> All other comment lines should start with a single "#" at front-of-line.
These comment characters will be stripped away by the awk.info renderer.
<li>Awk.info's renderer adopts the following html shorthand. If a line starts with
<pre>
#.WORD other words 
</pre>
<p>this this is replaced with
<pre>
&lt;WORD> other words&lt;/WORD>
</pre>
<p>If no <em>other words</em> follow <em>#.WORD</em> then the line becomes just <em>&lt;WORLD></em>
<li>Awk.info's renderer supports a few HTML extensions:
<ul>
<li><em>#.IN path</em> includes a file found in the LAWKER repositoriy at some <em>path</em> inside the trunk.
<li> <em>#.CODE path</em> includes the contents
of <em>path</em>, wrapped in  &ltpre> tags, and prefixed by the path.
<li> <em>#.BODY path</em> is the same as  <em>#.CODE</em> but it
skips the first paragraph (this is useful when the first paragraph includes tedious  details 
you want to hite from the user). 
<li>Note that, for <em>#.IN, #.CODE, #.BODY</em>, the <em>path</em> must appear after a single space.
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
That's it. Now you can pretty print your code on the web just be adding
a little html in the comments.  If you want to preview how your page looks if it was renfered by awk.info,
use the preview url:
<pre>
http://awk.info/?awk:urlWithoutHTTPprefix
</pre>
<p>For exmaple, the file <a href="http://menzies.us/tmp/xx.awk">http://menzies.us/tmp/xx.awk</a> 
can be previewed using
<a href="http://awk.info/?awk:menzies.us/tmp/xx.awk">http://awk.info/?awk:menzies.us/tmp/xx.awk</a>
