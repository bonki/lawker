<p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/lawker/source/browse/">LAWKER</a>
 is a repository of  Awk code divided into:
<dl>
<dt>fridge
</dt><dd> Fresh code (for the current trunk).  Best place to
start is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/lawker/source/browse/#svn/fridge/gawk">fridge/gawk</a>.
<dt>block</dt><dd>Place to chop up and experiment with code. Usually, avoid this one.
<dt>freezer</dt><dd>Frozen code. place to store tags. Currently, empty. But we plan to
grow this one.
<dt>wiki</dt><dd>Wiki pages. Useful for documentation but, where possible, use the
in-line pretty print method, described below.</dd>
</dl>
</ul>
<h2>How to contribute to LAWKER</h2>
<p>Anyone can post code to comp.lang.awk with the subject line "LAWKER contrib:". Unless
someone there finds bugs, it will be grabbed and added to LAWKER.
<p>Alternatively, members of LAWKER can  just <em>svn commit</em> their code.
<h2> Pretty Print Code</h2>
The code that renders the awk.info web site can "pretty print" awk code stored
in lawker.  For example,
<a href="http://awk.info/?gawk/array/join.awk">http://awk.info/?gawk/array/join.awk</a>
pretty
prints the Awk code found in
<a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/gawk/array/join.awk">join.awk</a>.
<p>
To enable that pretty print, add some html syntax inside your
code and apply the following convetions:
<ul>
<li> The first paragraph of the file will be ignored. Use this first para
for copyright notices or comments about down-in-the weeds trivia. Note: the
first para ends with one blank line.

<li>The next paragraph should start with 
<pre>#&lt;h1>&lt;join>Title&lt;/join>&lt;/h1></pre>

<li> The code could should be topped and tailed as follows:
<pre>
#&lt;pre>
code
#&lt;/pre>
</pre>
<li> All other comment lines should start with a single "#" at front-of-line.
These comment characters will be stripped away by the awk.info renderer.
</ul>
<p>
That's it. Now you can pretty print your code on the web just be adding
a little html in the comments. 
<p>
Note that this imposes a few constraints on your code:
<ul>
<li>Try and
keep the line widths to less than 60 characters.
<li>Favor lots of short
functions with comments in between them, rather than larger ones- it
will be easier on the eye.
</ul>
