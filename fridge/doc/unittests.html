<h1><join>Show Unit Tests</join></h1>
<p>Ideally, all code comes with unit tests:
<ul>
<li>Either demo scripts to show off functionality
<li>Or a regression suite that checks that new changes does not mess up existing code.
</ul>
<p>Accordingly  code offered to this site can contain unit tests, using the methods
described in this page. 
<p>
But before going on, we stress that 
awk.info  gratefully accepts
awk contributions in any form. That is,  including unit tests with code is <em>optional</em>. 
<ul>
<li>If your code is in directory <em>yourcode</em> then create a sub-directory <em>yourcode/eg</em>
<li>Write a test in a file <em>yourcode/eg/yourtest</em>. Divide that test into two parts:
<ol>
<li>In the first paragraph of that file, write any tedious set up required to get the system ready for the test.
<li>In the second, third, etc paragraph, write the code that shows the test
<li>
For example, in the following code, the real test comes after some low-level environmental set up:
<pre>
# assumes
# - the LAWKER trunk has been checked out and
# - .bash_profile contains: export Lawker="$HOME/svns/lawker/fridge"
. $Lawker/lib/bash/setup

gawk -f join.awk --source '
BEGIN { split("tim tom tam",a)
        print join(a,2)
}'
</pre>
</ol>
<li>Write the expected output of that test case in <em>yourcode/eg/yourtest.out</em>
<li>To show the test case, add the following into your .awk file:
<pre>
 #.BODY       yourcode/eg/yourtest
 #.CODE       yourcode/eg/yourtest.out
</pre>
</ol>
<P>That's it. Now, when awk.info displays that file, the test case trivia is hidden and the users only see the essential details.
<p>Also, an automatic tool can run over the entire code base and perform a regression test (checking if all the tests generate
all the <em>*.out</em> files.
