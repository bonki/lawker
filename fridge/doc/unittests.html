<h1><join>Show Unit Tests</join></h1>
<p>Ideally, all code comes with unit tests:
<ul>
<li>Either demo scripts to show off functionality
<li>Or a regression suite that checks that new changes does not mess up existing code.
</ul>
<p>Accordingly  code offered to this site can contain unit tests, using the methods
described in this page. 
<p>
But before going on, we stress that 
awk.info  gratefully accepts
awk contributions in any form. That is,  including unit tests with code is <em>optional</em>. 
<ul>
<li>If your code is in directory <em>yourcode</em> then create a sub-directory <em>yourcode/eg</em>
<li>Write a test in a file <em>yourcode/eg/yourtest</em>. Divide that test into two parts:
<ol>
<li>In the first paragraph of that file, write any tedious set up required to get the system ready for the test.
<li>In the second, third, etc paragraph, write the code that shows the test
</ol>
For example:
.IN array/eg/join
<li><em>#.IN path</em> includes a file found in the LAWKER repositoriy at some <em>path</em> inside the trunk.
<li> <em>#.CODE path</em> includes the contents
of <em>path</em>, wrapped in  &ltpre> tags, and prefixed by the path.
<li> <em>#.BODY path</em> is the same as  <em>#.CODE</em> but it
skips the first paragraph (this is useful when the first paragraph includes tedious  details 
you want to hite from the user). 
<li>Note that, for <em>#.IN, #.CODE, #.BODY</em>, the <em>path</em> must appear after a single space.
</ul>
