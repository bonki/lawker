<h1><join>Show Unit Tests</join></h1>
<p>Ideally, all code comes with unit tests:
<ul>
<li>Either demo scripts to show off functionality
<li>Or a regression suite that checks that new changes does not mess up existing code.
</ul>
<p>Accordingly (and optionally), code offered to this site can contain unit tests, using the methods
described in this page. But before going on, we stress that 
awk.info  gratefully accepts
awk contributions in any form. That is,  including unit tests with code is <em>optional</em>. 
<ul>
<li>If your code is in directory <em>yourcode</em> then create a sub-directory <em>yourcode/egs</em>
<li><em>#.IN path</em> includes a file found in the LAWKER repositoriy at some <em>path</em> inside the trunk.
<li> <em>#.CODE path</em> includes the contents
of <em>path</em>, wrapped in  &ltpre> tags, and prefixed by the path.
<li> <em>#.BODY path</em> is the same as  <em>#.CODE</em> but it
skips the first paragraph (this is useful when the first paragraph includes tedious  details 
you want to hite from the user). 
<li>Note that, for <em>#.IN, #.CODE, #.BODY</em>, the <em>path</em> must appear after a single space.
</ul>
