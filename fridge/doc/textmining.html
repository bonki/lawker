<h1><join>Text Mining</join></h1>
<p>Some of the code at awk.info is somewhat historical in nature. For example, Scott Pakin's <a href="http://awk.info/?gender">gender
predictor</a> was written in 1991. Given that, it might be mistakenly concluded that Awk is somehow old-fashioned and not suitable
for 21st century tasks.
<p>Text mining, on the other hand, could be the killer app for Awk in the 21st century. 
The language excels at creating one-off reports that handle the quirks
of a particular file format. 
<h2>Why Text Mining?</h2>
<p>If we could properly understand unstructured text, this would 
be a result of tremendous practical importance. A <a href="http://www.b- eye- network.com/view/2098">recent study</a>
concluded that: 
<uil>
<li> 80 percent of business is conducted on unstructured information; 
<li>
85 percent of all data stored is held in an unstructured 
format;
<li>
Unstructured data doubles every three months; 
</ul>
<p>That is, if we can tame the text mining problem, it would 
be possible to reason and learn from a much wider range of 
business  data than ever before. 
<h2>Results</h2>

Further, despite its maturity (euphimism for "written a very long time ago"),
Awk still runs as fast (or faster) than supposedly more modern langauges (perhaps because it its simple- fewer layers between the data
and the processing). Donald McCarthy's <a href="http://awk.info/?doc/textmine/textmunge.html">comparative analysis</a>
show that Awk is not necessarily slower
than certain other script-based text miners.
<li>Menzies and Marcus  <a href="?textmine/severis.html">prototyped a set of scripts to text mine NASA issue reports</a>.

Lothar M. Schmitt and Kiel T. Christianson discuss a more general tool kit in 
<a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/share/pdf/languageAnalysis.pdf">
Combining the Bourne-shell, sed and awk in the UNIX 
environment for language analysis</a> 
</ul>
<p>
Note that, in the Menzies/Marcus and Schmitt/Christianson tool kits,   Awk but itself was not enough. The two data mining toolkits mentioned above were all intricate
combinations of Awk and sed and bash and etc end etc.  Within that combination, Awk was very useful for handling the specifics not managed by the

<h2>Trends</h2>
There is a growing interest in using Awk for this kind of work.
All the examples presented above come from 2007,2008:
<ul>
<li>While Schmitt and Christianson wrote their toolkit in 2000, it is of much interest to contemporary audiences. The recently
published their workbench as <em>Linguistic

Mining</a>,  Springer, 2007.
<li>Menzies and Marcus published their Awk-based text mining results at the IEEE ICSM conference in 2008.
<li>
Donald McCarthy's <a href="http://awk.info/?doc/textmine/textmunge.html">comparative analysis</a>
was conducted in 2007.
