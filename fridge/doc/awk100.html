<h1><join>The Awk 100</join></h1>


<p>Awk is being used all around the world for real programming problems,
 but the news is not getting out. 
<p>If you, or your colleagues or friends have 
written a program which has been used for purposes small or large, 
why not take five minutes to record the facts, so that others can see what you've done?

<p>We are aiming to create a database of at least one hundred Awk programs which will:

<ul>
<li>Identify the tasks that Awk is really being used for
<li>Enable analysis of the benefits of the language for practical programming
<li>Serve as an information exchange for applications
</ul>
