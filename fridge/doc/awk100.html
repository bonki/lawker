<h1><join>The Awk 100</join></h1>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Awk is being used all around the world for real programming problems,
 but the news is not getting out. 

<p>We are aiming to create a database of at least one hundred Awk programs which will:

<ul>
<li>Identify the tasks that Awk is really being used for
<li>Enable analysis of the benefits of the language for practical programming
<li>Serve as an information exchange for applications
</ul>

<h2>Contribute</h2>

<p>If you, or your colleagues or friends have 
written a program which has been used for purposes small or large, 
why not take five minutes to record the facts, so that others can see what you've done?
<p>To contribute, fill in this <a href="http://lawker.googlecode.com/svn/fridge/doc/awk100/template.txt">template</a>
and mail it to <a href="mailto:mail@awk.info?subject=Awk 100 contribution">mail@awk.info</a> with the subject line <em>Awk 100 contribution</em>.
