<li>
The name Awk comes from the initials of its designers: Alfred V. Aho, Peter J. Weinberger, and Brian W. Kernighan. <li>The original version of Awk was written in 1977 at AT&T Bell Laboratories. 
<li>In 1985 a new version made the programming language more powerful, introducing user-defined functions, multiple input streams, and computed regular expressions. This new version became generally available with Unix System V Release 3.1. 
<li>
The version in System V Release 4 added some new features and also cleaned up the behavior in some of the "dark corners" of the language. 
<li>The specification for Awk in the POSIX Command Language and Utilities standard further clarified the language based on feedback from both the Gawk designers, and the original Bell Labs Awk designers.
<lu>
The GNU implementation, Gawk, was written in 1986 by Paul Rubin and Jay Fenlason, with advice from Richard Stallman. John Woods contributed parts of the code as well. 
<li>In 1988 and 1989, David Trueman, with help from Arnold Robbins, thoroughly reworked Gawk for compatibility with the newer Awk. 
<li>Current development focuses on bug fixes, performance improvements, standards compliance, and occasionally, new features.
