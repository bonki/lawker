<p>Recipe for a language:
<ul>
<li>

	1 part egrep 	
<li>1 part snobol
	<li>2 parts ed 	
<li>3 parts C

   <li> Blend all parts well using lex and yacc. Document minimally and release.
<li>
    After eight years, add another part egrep and two more parts C. Document very well and release. 
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
1977-1985: awk, now also known as 'old awk' or (confusingly) 'awk': the original version of the language, lacking many of the features that make it fun to play with now
<li>1985-1996: The GNU implementation, Gawk, was written in 1986 by Paul Rubin and Jay Fenlason, with advice from Richard Stallman. John Woods contributed parts of the code as well. 
In 1988 and 1989, David Trueman, with help from Arnold Robbins, thoroughly reworked Gawk for compatibility with the newer Awk. 
<li>1996: BWK awk was released under an open license. Huzzah!
<li>Sometime before the present, mawk, xgawk, jawk, awkcc, Kernighan's nameless awk-to-C++ compiler, awka, tawk and busybox awk came to be.
<p>It's a bit embarassing to note that the exact origins of each are a bit hazy. This whole section requires further work, including the addition of links pointing to source repositories and binary distribution points.
