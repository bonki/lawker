<a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~loui/cs436advice.html">Project Management Advice</a>:
<ul>
<li> Easy is not wrong.
<li>More programming theory does not make better programmers.
<li>Don't let old/compiler people tell you what language to use.
<li> If there is already a way of doing something, do not invent a harder way.
<li> Listen to people who program, not to people who want to tell you how to program. 
</ul>

<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieter_Rams">Dieter Rams</a> 
"Less, but Better" 10 commandments of  design:
<ul>

<li>Good design is a s little design as possible
</ul>

<p>The Enlightened Ones say that you should:
<ul><li> Never use C if you can do it with a script, 
<li>Never use a script if you can do it with awk, 
</ul>
