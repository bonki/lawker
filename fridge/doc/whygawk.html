<h1><join>Why Gawk?</join></h1>

"The Enlightened Ones say that....
<ul>
<li>You should never use C if you can do it with a script;
<li> You should never use a script if you can do it with awk;

<li> Never use awk if you can do it with sed;
<li>   Never use sed if you can do it with grep."
</ul>

<p>Awk is a good old-fashioned UNIX filtering tool invented in the
1970s. The language is simple and Awk programs are generally very
short. Awk is useful when the overheads of more sophisticated
approaches is not worth the bother. 

<p>The cost of learning Awk is very low.

<p>But aren't there better scripting languages? 
Faster? Well, maybe <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/classes/2002/w4115/scripting.9up.pdf" title="Scripting languages (2002) by Stephen A. Edwards; Department of Computer Science; Columbia University;">maybe yes</a> and <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/bwk/interps/pap.html" title="Timing Trials, or, the Trials of Timing: Experiments with Scripting and User-Interface Languages  by Brian W. Kernighan and Christopher J. Van Wyk; ">maybe no</a>. </p>

<p>And GAWK is old (mid-70s). Aren't modern languages more productive? 
Well
again, maybe yes and maybe no. One measure of the productivity of a
language is how lines of code are required to code up one business level
`function point'. 
Compared to many
popular languages, GAWK scores very highly:</p>

<pre><code>loc/fp   language

    6,   excel 5
   13,   sql
   21,   awk       &lt;================

  107,   cobol

  128,   c
  320,   1st generation default
  640,   machine language
 3200,   natural language
</code></pre>

<p>Anyway, there are other considerations. GAWK is real succinct, simple
enough to teach, and easy enough to recode in C (if you want raw speed).
For examples,  here's the complete listing of someone's Awk spell-checking program.</p>

<pre><code>BEGIN { 
    while (getline &lt; "Usr.Dict.Words") 
        dict[$0] = 1
}
{   if (!dict[$1]) print $1
}
</code></pre>

<p>Sure, there's about a gazillion enhancements you'd like to make on this one but you gotta say, this is real succinct.</p>

<p>Awk is the cure for  late execution
of software syndrome (a.k.a. LESS). The symptoms of LESS are a huge time
delay before a new idea is executable. Awk programmers can hack up usable 
systems in the time it takes other programmers to boot their IDE.

<p>Sure, we can drool over the language features offered by more advanced
languages like pointers, generic iterators, continuations, etc etc. And
Awk's lack of data structures (except num, string, and array) requires
some discipline to handle properly.
But   experienced Awk programmers know that  have showed me that the cleverer
the program, the
smaller the audience gets. 
 If it is possible for to explain something
succinctly in a simple language like Awk, then it is also possible that
more folks will read that code.
