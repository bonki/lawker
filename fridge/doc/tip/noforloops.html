<h1><join>Never write a for loop again?</join></h1>
<p>by Jim Hart
<p>I've written this kind of thing
<pre>
n = split(something,arr,/re/)
for(i=1;i<=n;i++) {
   print arr[i]
}
</pre>
<p>so often, it's tedious. I like this better:
<pre>
n = split(something,arr,/re/)
while(n--) {
   print arr[i++]
}
</pre>
<p>Easier to type. And, in cases where front-to-back or back-to-front
doesn't matter, it's even simpler:
<pre>
# copy a number indexed array, assuming n contains the number of
# elements

while(n--) arr2[n] = arr1[n]
</pre>
<P>The <em>n--</em> trick is not recommended if you need to use <em>n</em> again, but otherwise it should be fine.
<p>And, yes,
<pre>
for(i in arr1) arr2[i] = arr1[i]
</pre>
<p>works, too. But, some loops don't involve arrays. :-)
