<h1><join>Domain-Specific Langauges</join></h1>
<p><a href="?Dsl">These pages</a> focus on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_programming_language">domain-specific languages</a>
 (a.k.a. "little langauges") written in Awk.
<p>These little languages can range from the simple to the very complex. For example,
LAWKER contains code for
<ul>
<li><a href="?dsl/markdown">Markdown</a>- an ultra lightweight HTML markup language
<li><a href="?dsl/awklisp">AwkLisp</a>- a fully functioning LISP interpreter written in Awk
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, without comments, the LISP interpreter is only three times longer than the HTML markup language.
This comments either on the power of Awk,  the regularity of LISP's core semantics, or both.
