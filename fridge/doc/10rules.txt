Awk programmers know that "less, but better" is the way to write
software.

"Less, but better" was the mantra of Dieter Rams who offered the
following 10 Commandments of Design:

1. Good design is innovative
2. Good design makes a product useful
3. Good design is esthetic
4. Good design helps a product to be understood
5. Good design is unobtrusive
6. Good design is honest
7. Good design is durable
8. Good design is consistent to the last detail
9. Good design is concerned with the environment
10. Good design is a s little design as possible

Rams changed the face of modern design by creating a revolutionary
look and feel to the products of the Germany manufacturer Braun. His
impact on 20th and 21st century design cannot not be over-stated. Look
at any Apple product and Rams will be starting back at you. 

As you type your gawk, feel free to chant the 10 commandments.
