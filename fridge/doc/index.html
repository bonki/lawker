<p> 
Awk is a stable, cross platform programming language named after its three original authors
(Alfred Aho,
  Brian Kernighan,
  Peter  Weinberger) who write
<ul><em>
"Awk is a convenient and expressive programming language that can be
  applied to a wide variety of computing and data-manipulation tasks".</em>
</ul>
<p>Arnold Robbins writes:
<ul>
<em>
<P">We like it. A lot. ... 
Even though many Awk programs are short,
some of our larger Awk programs are thousands
of lines long. 
<p>"The simplicity and power of
Awk often make it just the right tool for the
job, and we seldom encounter a text processing
task in which we need a feature that is not
 already in the
language, or cannot be readily implemented.
<p>
"When we have on occasion rewritten and Awk program in a conventional
programming language like C or C++, the result was usually much
longer, and much harder to debug."
