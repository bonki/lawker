<h1><join>Welcome to Awk.Info</join></h1>

<p>In the beginning, there was <a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/awkbook/">one true Awk</a>. 
<p>Then came 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/">Gawk</a> which added many, many extensions. Gawk is widely available and widely used.
<p>Then came <a href="http://home.vrweb.de/~juergen.kahrs/gawk/XML/">Xgawk</a> which added  xml processing and dynamically loadable libraries.
Xgawk is an exciting experimental fork from the main Gawk branch.
<p>Currently, there are many Awk  implementations (see the list in the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awk">Wikipedia entry</a>).
