<p> 
Awk is a stable, cross platform programming language named for its 
authors
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/awkbook/">Alfred Aho,
  Brian Kernighan,
  Peter  Weinberger</a>. They write:
<ul><em>
"Awk is a convenient and expressive programming language that can be
  applied to a wide variety of computing and data-manipulation tasks".</em>
</ul>
<p> 
In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Classic-Shell-Scripting-Arnold-Robbins/dp/0596005954">Classic
Shell Scripting</a>, Arnold Robbins &amp; Nelson  Beebe confess their  Awk bias:
<ul>
<em>
<p>"We like it. A lot. 
<p>"The simplicity and power of
Awk often make it just the right tool for the
job.
<p>"We seldom encounter a text processing
task in which we need a feature that is not
 already in the
language, or cannot be readily implemented.
<p>
"When we have on occasion rewritten an Awk program in a conventional
programming language like C or C++, the result was usually much
longer, and much harder to debug."
</em>
</ul>
