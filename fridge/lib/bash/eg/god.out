<h1> The gang's all here</h1>
<p> Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth,</p>
<ul>
<li> upon this continent,</li>
<li> a new nation,</li>
<li> conceived in Liberty,</li>
<li> and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.</li>
</ul>
<h2> And here's the rest</h2>
<H3> More stuff</H3>
<P>
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation,
or any nation so conceived, and so dedicated, can long endure. We are
met here on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate
a portion of it as a final resting place for those who here gave their
lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper
that we should do this

<P>
But in a larger sense we can not dedicate - we can not consecrate - we
can not hallow this ground. 

<H2> More on the words</H2>

The brave men, living and dead, who
struggled, here, have consecrated it far above our poor power to add
or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say
here, but can never forget what they did here.
